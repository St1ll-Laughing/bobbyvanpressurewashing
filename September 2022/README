Couple of updates for you for your web site, see pics

* Bobby Vans house sold on 08/22/2022 - Not sure where he went, but he does not appear to be there any longer
* Missing from your site is the garage that he rents with the PB logo on front, and his POS limo with the same. See pics.
  Does not appear that he left town, as this is all still there since selling the shitty house.
